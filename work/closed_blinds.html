                <p>Closed Blinds is a fictional restaurant and wine producer that was created about my close friend and illustrator, Sarah Pilkinton. While trying to figure out what the brand would be about I read through Sarah's personal sketchbooks for inspiration.</p> 

                <p>I thought the intimate and dark drawings were amazing and decided to focus the brand around the sketches and the small passages written around them. The brand name comes directly from a list in her sketchbook of favorite things. Her twelfth favorite thing was "closed blinds" after other things such as “dog tag engraving machines,” “string lights,” and “overcast weather.”</p>

                <p>The fictional restaurant is also comedy bar in Baltimore, Maryland that opened in 2004. In 2015, the restaurant purchased a vineyard in Napa Valley and expanded its influence by releasing its very own collection of wines within the sub-brand of Closed Blinds Cellars. </p>
