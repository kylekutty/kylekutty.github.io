            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>For this class, we’re using mirrors to create illusionistic self portraits.  Give special attention to the composition and layout of the self portrait and include part of the edge of the mirror as part of your composition.</p>  

            <p>We think of mirrors as shiny and therefore associated with light.  The truth is that shiny surfaces are actually darker, both absorbing light and reflecting surrounding objects.  This intensifies the sense of brightness of the reflected light source, mirrors also subtract from the light.</p>  

            <p>Seeing in the mirror darkly- the mirror as the darker world. , Mirroring exists on all levels and may well be the basis of our ability to understand. Think about all of the metaphors surrounding the words reflection and mirror as a verb.</p>  

            <p>Perception depends on change, which is why boundaries are so important, leading the eye. Change of tone communicates the planes. Change of surface helps distinguish objects from each other in a group. Besides absorbing light, they also obey the rules of real distance.  It’s better to err on the too dark side than make it too light.</p>  

            <p>Artists use mirrors for images of introspection, self-interrogation, self-absorption, and a classic theme dating back to narcissus, enraptured by his own image.  They also use them to show another angle of the subject, more perspective and information, to enliven the composition with angles and the implication of another dimension.</p>  

            <p>A note on hair. One reason you don’t want to use a lot of lines is because you don’t want attention going everywhere but just to the most interesting parts that reveal the character of the hair.</p>  

            <p>Getting behind something seen in the mirror lets you makes use of the unexpected.</p>
