            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>Bring in items or papers you want to draw overlapping.  For example: envelopes, flyers, objects that represent you or a message you want to convey.   I would recommend not bringing in photographs or objects with a lot of surface detail.  If you don’t know what to bring you can always grab some mail or use items in your wallet.</p>

            <p>Tack the items you brought on the wall or lay them on a table with some overlapping. Use mach bands and fluid tonal change. Deal with text as blocks of gray. We don’t see as much in focus as we think. Bringing focus into copying letterforms generally will work against you because of the difficulty of getting letterforms exactly right and the fact it’s in focus getting more attention than you want. Deal with all areas as generally as possible at first.</p>

            <p>Technically, the first priority is mach bands. If you don’t get a good illusion of separation and something on top then the continuation part doesn’t really work, the shapes will just seem fused together. Then concentrate on the overall tones, stay general and keep comparing values to where they’re the same as other places to get some of the subtlety. Remember what happened with shadows, how they would get very dark and fairly sharp when the edge that cast it is close. As it gets faster from whatever cast the shadow the shadow gets lighter and softer.</p>

            <p>Don’t forget to squint your eyes and take a step back from time to time.  This will help you catch any illusionistic errors early on.</p>
