            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <!-- <p>Bring in items or papers you want to draw overlapping.  For example: envelopes, flyers, objects that represent you or a message you want to convey.   I would recommend not bringing in photographs or objects with a lot of surface detail.  If you don’t know what to bring you can always grab some mail or use items in your wallet.</p>

            <p>Tack the items you brought on the wall or lay them on a table with some overlapping. Use mach bands and fluid tonal change. Deal with text as blocks of gray. We don’t see as much in focus as we think. Bringing focus into copying letterforms generally will work against you because of the difficulty of getting letterforms exactly right and the fact it’s in focus getting more attention than you want. Deal with all areas as generally as possible at first.</p>

            <p>Technically, the first priority is mach bands. If you don’t get a good illusion of separation and something on top then the continuation part doesn’t really work, the shapes will just seem fused together. Then concentrate on the overall tones, stay general and keep comparing values to where they’re the same as other places to get some of the subtlety. Remember what happened with shadows, how they would get very dark and fairly sharp when the edge that cast it is close. As it gets faster from whatever cast the shadow the shadow gets lighter and softer.</p>

            <p>Don’t forget to squint your eyes and take a step back from time to time.  This will help you catch any illusionistic errors early on.</p> -->

            <p>In our brains, there are two cortical visual systems, referred to as the "what" and the "where" systems. The "where" system is responsible for interpreting space. This system will assesses overall ocmpositions of light and dark to interpret an environment. Because this system is so integral to understanding space and understanding the tone of the environment, spatial analogies make their way into our everyday expressions: "I feel like I'm in a corner," "I felt closed off." This system is important to artists because this can allow us to effect the viewer's visceral emotional response by using the proper composition. </p>

           	<p>The "what" system deals with details. This system controls facial recognition and object identification. When we draw surface we are working with the brain's "what" system. Surface illusion is one of the most difficult things to draw; hair, metallic objects, specific fabrics, etc. When we draw surface we are working with the brain's "what" system. What is important to understand is that the receptors for this system in the retina are the cones. The cones make up an extremely small fraction compared to the numbers of rods and they are primarily concentrated to the fovea. This means that only 2% of your vision is focussed at any time. The way this converts to drawing is that we cannot draw too much of the detail as not to diminsh the illusion.</p> 

           	<p>While we are not drawing every single hair, we are achieving that illusion by focussing on the lightest part of the object. The first area is the brightest bright of the object and the way that light breaks up around it. The second area is the region where the light shifts to shadow. And the third area is the outside edge. Darker objects have a more compact shape of light than light objects where the light tends to spread across the surface. Because of the shift and shimmer of light on a shiny surface we tend to think of them as light but the actual value is quite dark, with the darkest dark often falling next to the lightest light. </p>
