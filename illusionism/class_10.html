            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>Vision depends on expectations.</p>

            <p>Expectations affect how we see the relationship of detail to the shape or plane it’s found on since they include a basic ratio of how much detail to a particular size shape and scene. This class looks at how we can manipulate the relationship between them to create different impressions of scale. Many optical illusions depend on expectations of relationships between objects that are contradicted.</p>

            <p>WE are used to associating tiny objects with great distances and that is one of the foundations for a sense of bigness when we focus on smaller than expected detail. We tend to see a certain amount of detail on an object and if we see something smaller the object appears bigger. This is the key to creating the illusion of bigness or smallness.</p>

            <p>In addition, our tendency to see details in specific proportion to objects creates expectations about the common size ratio of detail to object. When that relationship varies it affects our sense of the size of the object. As the detail we focus on gets smaller in relation to the overall size, the object seems bigger. On a face we notice the features but maybe not the tiny mole inside the ear unless it’s someone important to us. Seeing a tinier detail than average communicates that importance.</p>

            <p>As our attention is led to smaller areas, we identify with them and the surrounding area grows. You could think of the smallest detail focused upon as the unit of measure for the whole. So if you can only fit five of that detail into the object, the object feels small, whereas if you can fit a thousand of the details into the object it will be perceived as much larger. More detail on a particular object will draw our focus and will make it appear as larger and it’s mass more convincing, compared to smaller objects with less detail. This technique can be used in any context, whether abstract or realistic. It does not depend on our recognition of what we’re seeing but just of the relationship between the detail and its surroundings. It’s a tremendously powerful tool to convey importance to a subject. The element of focus is the key. Too much detail will become a surface and we won’t focus on a particular area. Something tiny that we don’t notice won’t make any difference to our sense of size. What works best is a tiny detail in a part of the composition that we are led to naturally by the structure of the image.</p>

            <p>This can be tried with any type of object, though irregular objects work best initially because whatever has a regular pattern may not engage focus. For this class we we’re using small lumpy rocks and magnifying them to create a landscape or the illusion of scale</p>
