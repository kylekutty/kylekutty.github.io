            <h6>Summary</h6>

            <p>Trompe loeil has always been a part of art history. By expanding our set ups beyond just scraps of white paper, we discover a lot of potential in affecting the viewer with the printed material chosen.</p>

            <p>As we learned in the first class, illusionism is achieved through the amount of processing that you are able to cause inside the viewer's brain. The more processing that the brain does; the more the viewer will believe the drawn material is real. A way to cause the brain to do more work is by playing with the concept of continuation. Continuation is when the brain completes what is not visible. For example, in your drawings the brain will fill in an image or printed material that may be obscured by another sheet of paper. This causes the viewer's brain to do more work and amplifies the illusion.</p>

            <p>Another way that you can affect the viewer's reading of your drawing is through qualia. Qualia are the sorts of personality of the object. For example, imagine three boarding passes: one that is pristine and taped to the refrigerator with anticipation, another that is crumbled, wet and, torn in a waste basket, and lastly, a slightly wrinked one pinned on a wall with dozens of others like it. All of these were the same object, a boarding pass, however the qualia of each object had a very different impression on the viewer.</p>

            <p>We will lay our first ground in class today. This will save a lot of time in establishing existing value and will allow us to establish the overall tones of the composition with an eraser. A technique for lightening a general area would be to flatten your kneaded eraser and drag it lightly across the surface. Remeber not to draw with the eraser. Laying down the general, overall tonal values will icrease your sensitivity to tone. Always work from general to specific. When you do start laying in more value with your pencil remeber that the printed material will have less contrast than the edges which should be intensified.</p>
<!-- 
            In-class drawing- Employ the concept of continuation in a trompe l’oeil drawing of overlapped papers with printing or drawing on them.
            -Lay a 10% grey ground and pull out highlights for the entire composition before using pencils.
            -Use the whole range of leads to help match the light/dark relationships in the composition
            -Work from general to specific
            -What’s printed on paper will have less contrast than edges which should be intensified. (mach bands)
            -Qualia are the condition of the papers
            -Continue using mach bands to distinguish between real edges and lines on paper.
            -Develop sensitivity to tone  -->
